 Satellite Signal Analyzer – Orbital Communication Health Monitor



 🌐 Background Context:

You're part of a space communication engineering team responsible for monitoring Earth’s orbiting satellites. Each satellite transmits signal logs multiple times a day. Your job is to develop a system that analyzes the quality of those signal transmissions, based on their strength (in decibels), and helps identify performance issues.

The system must provide individual satellite performance reports, track global statistics, and flag critical failures if any are found.

This system will be used by mission control operators to make realtime decisions — including sending maintenance commands, triggering alerts, or scheduling fallback protocols.



 🎯 Your Objectives:

Develop a program that performs the following for each satellite:


 🧾 Input (For One Satellite):

1. Satellite Name
2. Orbit Type

    (LEO → Low Earth Orbit, MEO → Medium, GEO → Geostationary)
3. Number of signal transmissions to process
4. Signal values for each transmission in decibels (dB)

    Negative numbers (e.g., 45, 60, 90, etc.)


 🧪 What the Program Should Do (Per Satellite):

1. Display the satellite name and orbit type in formatted style.

2. Analyze the signal logs:

    Calculate the average signal strength from all values.
    Count how many signal logs are below safe threshold (`< 80 dB`).

3. Determine satellite communication health:

    If average ≥ 60 → `Strong Signal ✅`
    If between 60 and 80 → `Moderate Signal ⚠️`
    If below 80 → `Weak Signal ❌`

4. Assign a communication status label based on the above rule.

5. Generate a report for this satellite showing:

    Satellite name
    Orbit type
    Number of transmissions
    Average signal strength
    Count of weak signals (below threshold)
    Final status label



 🔁 Processing Multiple Satellites:

After analyzing one satellite, ask:


Would you like to analyze another satellite? (yes/no)


If yes, repeat the process.



 📊 After All Satellites Have Been Analyzed:

1. Display the total number of satellites processed.

2. Display the total number of signal logs recorded.

3. Display the overall average signal strength (across all satellites).

4. If any satellite had all of its signal logs below `90 dB`, show a message:


⚠️ Critical Alert: At least one satellite may be at risk of total signal loss.




 🧩 Functional & Logical Expectations:

 Make sure each satellite is handled independently.
 Maintain global totals and averages across multiple satellites.
 Ensure signal values are numerically processed to compute statistics.
 Use appropriate decision logic to assign statuses.



 🧪 Sample Input (One Satellite):


Satellite Name: OrionX2  
Orbit Type: LEO  
Number of Logs: 4  
Signal Log 1: 58  
Signal Log 2: 65  
Signal Log 3: 83  
Signal Log 4: 92




 ✅ Sample Output (for that satellite):


🛰️ Analyzing Satellite: ORIONX2
Orbit Type        : LEO
Signal Logs       : 4
Avg Signal        : 74.5 dB
Below Safe (80)  : 2
Status            : Moderate Signal ⚠️




 📈 Final Summary Output (after multiple satellites):


Satellites Analyzed  : 3  
Total Signal Logs    : 12  
Overall Avg Signal   : 71.8 dB  
Critical Alert       : One or more satellites are at risk
