 Travel Itinerary & Cost Estimator

You are working with a travel agency that offers custom tour packages. Customers provide their travel preferences including a list of places they want to visit, a short note about their expectations, and their travel budget.

Write a program that:

1. Accepts a comma-separated list of destinations from the user. Some destinations may include the phrase “Must Visit” to indicate priority locations.

2. Accepts a one-line sentence describing the traveler’s preferences.

3. Accepts the overall trip budget as a number.

4. Accepts the number of days the user wants to spend at each destination.


The program should:

 Display each destination clearly, one per line with numbering.

 Count how many destinations are marked as "Must Visit" and how many are not.

 Identify the type of trip based on the note provided by the user.
  (Examples: “I want a luxury experience”, “We are on a tight budget”)

 Calculate the total cost of the trip:

   ₹3,500 per day for each “Must Visit” destination
   ₹2,500 per day for other destinations

 Based on the cost and the budget provided, display whether the trip is approved or not.

Destinations: Paris - Must Visit, Tokyo, Goa - Must Visit, Dubai, Tokyo
