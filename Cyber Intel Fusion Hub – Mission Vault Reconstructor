Scenario: Cyber Intel Fusion Hub â€“ Mission Vault Reconstructor

Background:
You are the lead backend engineer for the Cyber Intelligence Fusion Hub (CIFH). Highly encrypted mission records are uploaded from remote spy stations and stored in a secure vault. These logs are extremely obfuscated, contain mixed formatting styles, embedded flags, variable-length identifiers, and localized date formats.

Due to a national emergency, you are tasked with rebuilding the vault logs into a human-readable format using only core Java features. You are allowed to use regular expressions (regex), but not collections or arrays.

Input Format:
The logs come in a single encrypted String. Each entry is wrapped between <ENTRY> and </ENTRY>. Inside each entry, the following fields appear in random order, with inconsistent formatting and delimiters:

 Agent: AGENT:{\[CountryCode-AgentID]}
 Mission Code: MISSION=CODE-Operation\_Name\_Level
 Status Flag: <STATUS>\[flag\_value]</STATUS>
 Local Time: TIME\[DD-MM-YYYY|hh\:mm\:ss] or TIME\[YYYY/MM/DD hh\:mm\:ss]
 Cipher Key: CIPHER<<[KEY@ZONE](mailto:KEY@ZONE)>>

All entries are concatenated in a block string with line breaks.

Sample Input:

<ENTRY>
TIME[12-07-2025|23:45:10]
AGENT:{[IND-1007]}
<STATUS>[ACTIVE]</STATUS>
CIPHER<<<DELTA@INDIA>>>
MISSION=CODE-Midnight_Thunder_High
</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>
<STATUS>[ABORTED]</STATUS>
TIME[2025/07/10 03:20:30]
AGENT:{[UK-2002]}
MISSION=CODE-Shadow_Eagle_Medium
CIPHER<<<OMEGA@UK>>>
</ENTRY>
<ENTRY>
MISSION=CODE-Wolf_Pack_Low
AGENT:{[US-3033]}
TIME[2025/07/09 04:10:00]
<STATUS>[SUSPENDED]</STATUS>
CIPHER<<<ALPHA@USA>>>
</ENTRY>


Your Task:
Build a Java application to parse and process the above logs using the following rules.

extract all blocks between <ENTRY> and </ENTRY>.


 Reverse the AgentID (e.g., IND-1007 becomes 7001-DNI), then append #ZONE
 Status mapping:
  ACTIVE becomes ON MISSION
  SUSPENDED becomes STANDBY
  ABORTED becomes TERMINATED
 Risk mapping:
  High becomes CRITICAL
  Medium becomes MODERATE
  Low becomes MINIMAL
 Time formatting:
  Convert both date formats (DD-MM-YYYY|HH:mm:ss and YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss) to "dd MMM yyyy, hh:mmAM/PM"

Each line of output must be formatted using StringJoiner in this format:

EncryptedAgentID | Mission Title | Risk | Status | Time | CipherKey

Sample Output:

7001-DNI#INDIA | Midnight Thunder |  CRITICAL | ON MISSION | 12 Jul 2025, 11:45PM | DELTA
2002-KU#UK | Shadow Eagle |  MODERATE | TERMINATED | 10 Jul 2025, 03:20AM | OMEGA
3303-SU#USA | Wolf Pack |  MINIMAL | STANDBY | 09 Jul 2025, 04:10AM | ALPHA
